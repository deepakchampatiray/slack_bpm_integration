# Slack integration with IBM BPM
### This library aims to make it easier to integrate IBM BPM with Slack APIs inorder to experience better collaboration. We have listed down some of the features that we would like to have in this library. Please feel free to submit your feature requests or help adding new features.

### Some of the features that we have in mind for now are;
* Create a new group (private channel) and add some users to them inorder to help them collaborate. Afterwards, the system will pull all the messages and files shared in the channel and attach them to the process instance. [link](./docs/group_message_pull.md "Documentation")
